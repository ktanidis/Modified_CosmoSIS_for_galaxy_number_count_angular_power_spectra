[emcee]
; The emcee sampler uses the concept of walkers, a collection
; of live points.  Sampling is done along lines that connect
; pairs of walkers.  The number of walkers must be at least
; 2*nparam + 1, but in general more than that usually works
; better.
walkers = 64
; This many samples is overkill, just to make the plots
; look a lot nicer
samples = 400
; This is the interval at which convergence diagnostics
; are performed

; In adaptive MCMC the proposal covariance
; is gradually tuned whilst maintaining the overall
; chain convergence properties.  You could set:
; adaptive_mcmc = True
; and you would not need a covariance matrix.
; This converges faster than if you don't have a good
; covariance matrix but a little slower than if you have
; a good one.  It is a good choice for an initial run
; to get a good covmat.  In fact, that's how we made
