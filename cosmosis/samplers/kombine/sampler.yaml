explanation: >
    kombine is an ensemble sampler that uses a clustered kernel-density-estimate proposal density, which allows it to efficiently sample multimodal or non-gaussian posteriors. In between updates to the proposal density estimate, each member of the ensemble is sampled independently, allowing for massive parallelization.

    The total number of samples generated will be walkers * samples.


installation: >
    kombine needs to be installed separately: it can be installed from github using pip:

    pip install --user git+git://github.com/bfarr/kombine

params:
    walkers: (integer) number of independent walkers in the ensemble
    samples: (integer) total sample steps taken 
    nsteps: (integer) number of sample steps taken in between writing output
    update_interval: (integer) number of steps taken in between updating the posterior 
    start_file: (string; default='') a file containing starting points for the walkers. If not specified walkers are initialized randomly from the prior distribution.
