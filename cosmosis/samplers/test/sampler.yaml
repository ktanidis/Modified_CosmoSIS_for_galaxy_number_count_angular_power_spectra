    This is the most trivial possible 'sampler' - it just runs on a single
    parameter sample. It is mainly useful for testing and for generating 
    cosmology results for plotting.

    The test sampler uses the starting position defined in the value ini file,
    and runs the pipeline just on that.

    At the end of the run it will print out the prior and likelihood (if there
    is one), and can optionally also save all the data saved along the pipeline,
    so that you can make plots of the useful cosmological quantities.

    Experimental: we have a new test feature where you can plot your pipeline
    and the data flow through it as a graphical diagram.  This requires pygraphviz
    and the graphviz suite to make an image - use a command like:
    dot -Tpng -o graph.png graph.dot


installation: >
    No special installation required; everything is packaged with CosmoSIS.
    If you want to make a graphical diagram of your pipeline you need to have
    pygraphviz installed.  You can get this with:

    pip install pygraphviz  #to install centrally, may require sudo

    pip install pygraphviz --user #to install just for you
    
    You also need graphviz to turn the result into an image.


# List of configuration options for this sampler
params:
    fatal_errors:  (bool; default=N)Any errors in the pipeline trigger an immediate failure so you can diagnose errors
    save_dir: (string; default='') Save all the data computed in the pipeline to this directory (can also end with .tgz to get a zipped form)
    graph: (string; default='') Requires pygraphviz.  Save a dot file describing the pipeline
