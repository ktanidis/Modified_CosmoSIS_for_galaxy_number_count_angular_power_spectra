explanation: >
    Snake is a more intelligent version of the grid sampler that avoids
    taking large number of samples with a low likelihood, which the naive
    grid sampler nearly always does.

    It does ultimately have the same bad behaviour as you go to a higher
    number of dimensions, though you can push it higher than with the straight
    grid.

    The Snake sampler maintains a list of samples on the interior and surface
    of the parameter combinations it has explored.  This allows it to first move
    gradually towards the maximum likelihood and then gradually diffuse outwards
    from that point in all the different dimensions.

    Snake outputs can be postprocessed in exactly the same way as grid samples,
    with missing entries assumed to have zero posterior.
