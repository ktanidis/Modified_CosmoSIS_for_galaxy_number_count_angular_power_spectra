explanation: >
    Grid sampling is the simplest and most brute-force way to explore a parameter space.
    It simply builds an even grid of points in parameter space and samples all of them.

    As such it scales extremely badly with the number of dimensions in the problem:
    n_sample = grid_size ^ n_dim
    and so quickly becomes unfeasible for more than about 4 dimensions.

    It is extremely useful, though, in lower dimensions, where it is perfectly parallel
    and provides a much smoother and more exact picture of the parameter space than MCMC
    methods do.  It is also useful for taking lines and planes through the parameter space.

    The main parameter for the grid sampler is the number of sample points per dimension (grid_size above).
