    Importance sampling is a general method for estimating quantities from
    one distribution, P', when what you have is samples from another, similar
    distribution, P. In IS a weight is calculated for each sample that depends
    on the difference between the likelihoods under the two distributions.

    IS works better the more similar the two distributions are, but can also
    be useful for adding additional constraints to an existing data set.

    There's a nice introduction to the general idea in Mackay ch. 29:

    No special installation required; everything is packaged with CosmoSIS

params:
    input_filename: (string) cosmosis-format chain of input samples
    nstep: (integer; default=128) number of samples to do between saving output
    add_to_likelihood: (bool; default=N) include the old likelihood in the old likelihood; i.e. P'=P*P_new
