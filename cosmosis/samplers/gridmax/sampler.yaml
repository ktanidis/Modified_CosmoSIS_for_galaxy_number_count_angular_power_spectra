explanation: >
    This sampler is a naive and experimental attempt to try a parallel ML/MAP sampler.

    It samples through the dimensions of the space one-by-one, and draws a line of evenly
    space samples through that dimension, and finds the best fit along that line.

    It then changes that parameter value to the best fit, leaving all the others fixed.
    The idea is that at moves in on a "square spiral" towards the best fit.

    The sampling is parallel along the line.

    This sampler is experimental and should probably only be used for testing purposes.
