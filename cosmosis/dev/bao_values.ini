; Parameters and data in CosmoSIS are organized into sections
; so we can easily see what they mean.
; There is only one section in this case, called cosmological_parameters
[cosmological_parameters]

; These parameters are pretty much always required
; for cosmology, though you sometimes just fix omega_b
omega_m = 0.2 0.3 0.4
h0 = 0.5 0.72 0.9
baryon_fraction = 0.15
; Tau (optical depth) is only needed if you need
; the thermal history, or the CMB/matter power
tau = 0.08

; These parameters can affect everything but are not required - 
; if they are not found in this file they take the sensible
; default values shown here
omega_k = 0.0
w = -1.0
wa = 0.0
