# Modified_CosmoSIS_for_galaxy_number_count_angular_power_spectra

The code is a fully-operational modified version of the publicly available code \textbf{CosmoSIS}. In this modular cosmological parameter estimation suite for Limber approximated galaxy number count angular power spectra, we allow for single and multiple tracers, including density fluctuations, redshift-space distortions, and weak lensing magnification.
