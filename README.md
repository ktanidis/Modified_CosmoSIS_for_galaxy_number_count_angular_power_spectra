# Modified CosmoSIS for galaxy number count angular power spectra

# Description

The code is a fully-operational modified version of the publicly available package code CosmoSIS ([Zunts et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3409)). In this modular cosmological parameter estimation suite for galaxy number count Limber approximated angular power spectra, we allow for single and multiple tracers, including density fluctuations, redshift-space distortions, and weak lensing magnification.
