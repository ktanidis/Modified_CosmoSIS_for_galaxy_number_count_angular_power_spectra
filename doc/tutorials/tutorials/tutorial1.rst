Tutorial 1: Computing a single cosmology likelihood
---------------------------------------------------

This tutorial shows you how to build a pipeline to evaluate a single cosmology likelihood, in this case the Planck satellite's 2015 measurements of the cosmic microwave background. 

Installation
============

Before you start, :doc:`follow the instructions to install cosmosis </installation/installation>`.  Once you are complete, you should be able to run::

    cosmois --help

and see a usage message.

Parameter files
============================

Have a look at the file :code:`demos/demo2.ini`.  CosmoSIS is always run on a single parameter file like this.  It specifies how to construct a pipeline that generates a likelihood, and what to do with that likelihood once it is calculated.  

CosmoSIS parameter files use the :code:`ini` format, which has section names with square brackets around them and parameters specified with an equals sign.  This example says there is a section called :code:`runtime` with a parameter named :code:`sampler` with the values "test"::


    [runtime]
    sampler = test

Each CosmoSIS run uses at least two ini files, this one, called a parameter file, and a second *values* file, specifying the cosmological and other varied parameters used in the pipeline.  In this case the values file is :code:`demos/values2.ini`.

Running CosmoSIS on a parameter file
=====================================


Run CosmoSIS on this parameter file with this command::

    cosmosis demos/demo2.ini

You will see a lot of output showing:

* What parameters are used in this pipeline, e.g. ::

    Parameter Priors
    ----------------
    planck--a_planck                      ~ delta(1.0)
    cosmological_parameters--h0           ~ delta(0.6726)
    cosmological_parameters--omega_m      ~ delta(0.3141)


* The set-up phase for each step (module) in the calculation, e.g.::

    -- Setting up module camb --
     camb mode  =            1
     camb cmb_lmax =         2650
     camb FeedbackLevel =            2
     accuracy boost =    1.1000000000000001     
     HighAccuracyDefault =  T


* The sampler that is being run::

    ****************************
    * Running sampler 1/1: test
    ****************************

* The output of each module, e.g.::

    Running camb ...
    Reion redshift       =  11.751
    Integrated opt depth =  0.0800
    Om_b h^2             =  0.018096
    Om_c h^2             =  0.123356
    Om_nu h^2            =  0.000644

Defining a sampler
===================

The first lines in the parameter file :code:`demos/demo2.ini` are::

    [runtime]
    sampler = test

    [test]
    save_dir=demo_output_2
    fatal_errors=T

The first option, :code:`sampler`, tells CosmoSIS what it should do with the likelihood that we will construct - how the parameter space should be *sampled*.

CosmoSIS has lots of different samplers in it, designed to move around parameter spaces in different ways.  The :code:`test` sampler is the simplest possible one: it doesn't move around the parameter space at all - it just computes a likelihood (runs the pipeline) for a single set of values.  These tutorials will discuss several samplers; the full list is described in :doc:`the samplers page </reference/samplers/samplers>`.

Once you have chosen a sampler you configure that sampler with the second section shown in above, which has the name of the sampler, in this case :code:`test`.

Defining a pipeline
===================

Cosmological analyses use a *Likelihood Function* - a calculation of the probability of the observed data given some cosmological model.  In toy problems these likeliood functions are often just simple analytic functions.  In realistic cosmological problems they are usually long calculations with many parts.

In CosmoSIS you build up a likelihood function from a sequence of steps called *modules*.  Each module does a different piece of the calculation, often modelling different pieces of physics and different observed data sets.  You need to understand the calculation you are trying to do to build a CosmoSIS pipelines, and then put together the ingredients that it needs.

The pipeline is defined in the parameter file like this::

    [pipeline]
    modules = consistency camb planck bicep2
    ...
    likelihoods = planck2015

This tells CosmoSIS to run four modules, and to expect a likelihood called "planck2015" at the end.  The names of modules are not fixed - they refer to section names in the rest of the parameter file.  For example, the :code:`planck` module is specified futher down like this::

    [planck]
    file = cosmosis-standard-library/likelihood/planck2015/planck_interface.so
    data_1 = ${COSMOSIS_SRC_DIR}/cosmosis-standard-library/likelihood/planck2015/data/plik_lite_v18_TT.clik
    data_2 = ${COSMOSIS_SRC_DIR}/cosmosis-standard-library/likelihood/planck2015/data/commander_rc2_v1.1_l2_29_B.clik

The first option, which all modules must have, tells CosmoSIS where to find the file containing the code of this module. The other two options, :code:`data_1` and :code:`data_2` are passed to the module. In general it can do whatever it likes with them, but in this case the Planck module uses them to decide which data sets to generate the likelihood for.

The modules in this example are all part of the CosmoSIS Standard Library.  For your own analyses you could mix standard library modules with your own steps.  We have a list of all the standard library modules and their options, inputs, and outputs in the standard library reference.

Defining input values
======================

The pipeline we have built is a machine for turning a collection of numerical parameters into a single total likelihood.  We need some initial input values for the first module to take in::


    [pipeline]
    ...
    values = demos/values2.ini

This option points to the values file, the second cosmosis ini file.  The values file contains all the inputs that are passed to the pipeline.  For example::

    [cosmological_parameters]
    h0 = 0.6726       ;H0 (km/s/Mpc)/100.0km/s/Mpc 
    omega_m = 0.3141  ;density fraction for matter today
    omega_b = 0.04    ;density fraction for baryons today
    omega_k = 0.0     ;spatial curvature

This creates a category of parameters called :code:`cosmological_parameters` and within that a collection of named values.  The semi-colons begin comments.

Parameters can either have a fixed value, like the ones above, or they can have a range, like this::

    [cosmological_parameters]
    h0 = 0.6   0.6726   0.8

This doesn't make any difference for the test sampler, because it just uses the one central value.  But if you are sampling, as in the next tutorial, then that is the range that the parameters can take.
